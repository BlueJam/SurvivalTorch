keeps running even when the screen is off
For cameras where this doesn't work, a super low screen brightness option?

Timer for the light
Indicate if it is on!
Timer countdown shown on screen, good solution

Notification - Turn off from notification bar option?

In preferences, instead of using x minutes etc use the actual number

Make sure none of the fragments would break the app if they werent instanciated.
